/**
 * SOLID
 ** S - Single Responsibility: a class should have one and only one reason to change
 *? O - Open/Closed: classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
 *! L - Liskov Substitution: objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses
 ** I - Interface Segregation: a client should not be forced to depend on methods it does not use
 *! D - Dependency Inversion: classes should depend on abstractions interfaces, not concret classes
